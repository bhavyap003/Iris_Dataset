# Iris Classification with Scikit-learn

This project is a **practical implementation of Scikit-learn** using the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

Excel and Pandas are used to split the dataset into **training** and **test** sets within a Jupyter Notebook.  
Scikit-learn is then used to train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set.
